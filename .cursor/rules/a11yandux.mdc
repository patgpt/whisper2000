# UX and Accessibility Rules

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Use semantic widgets (`CupertinoListSection`, `CupertinoButton`, etc.)
- Ensure screen reader accessibility for all interactive elements.
- Maintain a contrast ratio of **4.5:1 or higher**.
- Label all buttons/icons using `Semantics` or `Tooltip`.
- Support larger text sizes and adaptive fonts.

## Interaction Design
- Tap targets must be at least **48x48dp**.
- Use haptics for important actions (`HapticFeedback.mediumImpact`).
- Keep a11y navigation order logical and intuitive.

## Motion & Animation
- Avoid excessive animation unless meaningful.
- Respect `reduceMotion` platform setting.
- All animations must have fallbacks for low-power modes.

## Responsiveness
- Use adaptive layouts for macOS vs Android/iOS.
- Respect safe areas and system UI overlays.
- Use `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder` to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Dark Mode
- Support light/dark mode toggle from `SettingsPage`.
- Ensure all colors adapt appropriately (especially text/icons).

## Error States
- Show user-friendly error messages (no raw exceptions).
- Offer retry actions where appropriate.

## Onboarding & Consent
- All sensitive features (recording, transcription, cloud AI) must be opt-in.
- Show a friendly onboarding modal with clear permissions explanation.

## UX Philosophy
- Minimalist and functional.
- Whisper-quiet interface â€” empower the user without overwhelming.
